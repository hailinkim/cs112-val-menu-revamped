Abstract: For our project, we put the menu meal data from AC Nutrition into a text file and sorted it by calorie, fat, protein, and carb count, type of meal (breakfast, lunch, or dinner), whether the meal is vegetarian, allergen, or vegan-friendly meal, and by different dietary needs (i.e. heavy protein meals for athletes or low-fat meals).
